Answer : If we assume that are input x has a linear relationship with the output y and that noise is normally defined, we can define y as a weighted sum of the elements in X. . $$ hat{Y} = sum ( W_i , X_i) + b $$ where X has i elements, W is the weight vector and B is the bias in our data . | . | . What is Bias ? . Answer : Bias (also called offset or intercept) - what value will y take if input is 0. It is also reflective of the error introduced by approximating a real life model, or how much the model prediction differs from the target value. Bias can also be introduced during modelling that assumes subject matter expertise about the data. A high bias can lead to underfitting. Bias is also used as regularization so that the model does not overfit to training data. . TLDR : High Bias Leads to Underfitting . | . | . What is Variance . Answer: Variance indicates how robust is your model to new data. A low variance means that you are certain about how the model will perform given new data. We want to have low variance in our model . Mathematically , variance error in the model is $$Var(f(x)) =E(X^2) - E(X)^2$$ . TLDR : High Variance Leads to Overfitting . | . | . What is Bias-Variance Tradeoff ? High Bias leads to underfitting and not learning enough from training data, and High Variance leads to overfitting on training data and not being robust enough for test data. The error on a model is a sym off the Bias, Variance and Irreducible Error of the model . $$Err(x) = Bias^2 + Variance + Irreducible Error$$ If the model is too simple(less features) then high bias and low variance | If the model is complicated (more features) then low bias and high variance | The tradeoff to find a good balance between bias and variance that minimizes the error is called Bias-Variance Tradeoff | . | . | .

            "content": "Matplotlib . Matplotlib is the most commonly used python library. While its not the most intuitive library , it has a lot of adoption. Here are some commonly use commands in matplotlib. . To set figure size :import figure and use figure.figsize&gt; For scatterplot use plt.scatter . import matplotlib.pyplot as plt . from matplotlib.pyplot import figure figure(figsize=(4, 3), dpi=80) import torch X = torch.normal(0, 1, (100, 2)) plt.scatter(X[:,(0)].detach().numpy(), X[:, (1)].numpy()) . &lt;matplotlib.collections.PathCollection at 0x12dcdd910&gt; . X = torch.normal(0, 5, (50, 1)) plt.plot(X) . [&lt;matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x12f002040&gt;] . TSNE . Perplexity . Perplexity lossely defines how to balance attention between local and global aspects of your data. Os a guess about the number of close neighbours each point has. Typical values are between 5 and 50 - For lower vals - TSNE tensds to spread out projected data with very little preservation of flobal structure - Extremely high perplexity to begin seeing global structure - leads to. very high runtime . Interpretability . - Cluster sizes in tSNE plot mean nothing - Distances between clusters might not mean anything - Random noise doesn&#39;t always look random . PCA - Principal Component Analysis . UMAP : Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction . - UMAP , like TSNE uses Graph Layput Algorithms to arrange data in low-dimensional space. - Constructs a high dimensional graph of the data - *Fuzzy Simplicial Complex* - Representation of weighted graph with edge weights representing the likelihood that two points ate connected - Choose a radius (critical) - Extend a radius out from each point, connecting points in the radial distance of each other - Small radius -&gt; Isolated Clusters - Large radius -&gt; Connect Everything together - Choose a radius locally based on the distance to each point&#39;s nth nearest neighbour - Stipulate that each poibt ust be connected to atleast its closest neighbour - ensures local structure is preserved - Optimises a low dimensional graph to be structurally as similar as possible (Like Student - Teacher ? ) - Same process as TSNE but few clever tricks to speed up the process . Reference . UMAP Parameters . - n_neighbours : number of approximate nearest neighbours used to contruct the initial high dim graph . As this number increases, UMAP connects more neighbouring points when constructing graph represention of high dim data - min_dist : min dist b/w points in low dim space - How tighly UMAP clups points together . Low dist leads to more tightly packed embeddings . UMAP v/s TSNE v/s PCA . - UMAP is often better at preserving global structure in final projection - Inter-Cluster relations are potentially more meaningful than in t-SNE - Compared to PCA - any given axis or distance in lower dimensin isn&#39;t directly interpretable . UMAP Usage . UMAP can be installed by either conda or pip. To install using pip execute the command . pip install umap-learn . import umap .
