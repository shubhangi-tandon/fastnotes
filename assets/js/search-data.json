Perplexity . - For lower vals - TSNE tensds to spread out projected data with very little preservation of flobal structure - Extremely high perplexity to begin seeing global structure - leads to. very high runtime . PCA - Principal Component Analysis . UMAP : Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction . - UMAP , like TSNE uses Graph Layput Algorithms to arrange data in low-dimensional space. - Constructs a high dimensional graph of the data - *Fuzzy Simplicial Complex* - Representation of weighted graph with edge weights representing the likelihood that two points ate connected - Choose a radius (critical) - Extend a radius out from each point, connecting points in the radial distance of each other - Small radius -&gt; Isolated Clusters - Large radius -&gt; Connect Everything together - Choose a radius locally based on the distance to each point&#39;s nth nearest neighbour - Stipulate that each poibt ust be connected to atleast its closest neighbour - ensures local structure is preserved - Optimises a low dimensional graph to be structurally as similar as possible (Like Student - Teacher ? ) - Same process as TSNE but few clever tricks to speed up the process . Reference . UMAP Parameters . - n_neighbours : number of approximate nearest neighbours used to contruct the initial high dim graph . As this number increases, UMAP connects more neighbouring points when constructing graph represention of high dim data - min_dist : min dist b/w points in low dim space - How tighly UMAP clups points together . Low dist leads to more tightly packed embeddings . UMAP v/s TSNE v/s PCA . - UMAP is often better at preserving global structure in final projection - Inter-Cluster relations are potentially more meaningful than in t-SNE - Compared to PCA - any given axis or distance in lower dimensin isn&#39;t directly interpretable . UMAP Usage . UMAP can be installed by either conda or pip. To install using pip execute the command . pip install umap-learn . ! pip install umap-learn .

            "content": ". We are very pleased to announce the immediate availability of fastpages. fastpages is a platform which allows you to create and host a blog for free, with no ads and many useful features, such as: . Create posts containing code, outputs of code (which can be interactive), formatted text, etc directly from Jupyter Notebooks; for instance see this great example post from Scott Hawley. Notebook posts support features such as: Interactive visualizations made with Altair remain interactive. | Hide or show cell input and output. | Collapsable code cells that are either open or closed by default. | Define the Title, Summary and other metadata via a special markdown cells | Ability to add links to Colab and GitHub automatically. | . | Create posts, including formatting and images, directly from Microsoft Word documents. | Create and edit Markdown posts entirely online using GitHub&#39;s built-in markdown editor. | Embed Twitter cards and YouTube videos. | Categorization of blog posts by user-supplied tags for discoverability. | ... and much more | . fastpages relies on Github pages for hosting, and Github Actions to automate the creation of your blog. The setup takes around three minutes, and does not require any technical knowledge or expertise. Due to built-in automation of fastpages, you don&#39;t have to fuss with conversion scripts. All you have to do is save your Jupyter notebook, Word document or markdown file into a specified directory and the rest happens automatically. Infact, this blog post is written in a Jupyter notebook, which you can see with the &quot;View on GitHub&quot; link above. . fast.ai have previously released a similar project called fast_template, which is even easier to set up, but does not support automatic creation of posts from Microsoft Word or Jupyter notebooks, including many of the features outlined above. . Because fastpages is more flexible and extensible, we recommend using it where possible. fast_template may be a better option for getting folks blogging who have no technical expertise at all, and will only be creating posts using Github&#39;s integrated online editor. . Setting Up Fastpages . The setup process of fastpages is automated with GitHub Actions, too! Upon creating a repo from the fastpages template, a pull request will automatically be opened (after ~ 30 seconds) configuring your blog so it can start working. The automated pull request will greet you with instructions like this: . . All you have to do is follow these instructions (in the PR you receive) and your new blogging site will be up and running! . Jupyter Notebooks &amp; Fastpages . In this post, we will cover special features that fastpages provides for Jupyter notebooks. You can also write your blog posts with Word documents or markdown in fastpages, which contain many, but not all the same features. . Options via FrontMatter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # Title &gt; Awesome summary - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . All of the above settings are enabled in this post, so you can see what they look like! . the summary field (preceeded by &gt;) will be displayed under your title, and will also be used by social media to display as the description of your page. | toc: setting this to true will automatically generate a table of contents | badges: setting this to true will display Google Colab and GitHub links on your blog post. | comments: setting this to true will enable comments. See these instructions for more details. | author this will display the authors names. | categories will allow your post to be categorized on a &quot;Tags&quot; page, where readers can browse your post by categories. | . Markdown front matter is formatted similarly to notebooks. The differences between the two can be viewed on the fastpages README. . Code Folding . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . If you want to completely hide cells (not just collapse them), read these instructions. . Interactive Charts With Altair . Interactive visualizations made with Altair remain interactive! . We leave this below cell unhidden so you can enjoy a preview of syntax highlighting in fastpages, which uses the Dracula theme. . label = alt.selection_single( encodings=[&#39;x&#39;], # limit selection to x-axis value on=&#39;mouseover&#39;, # select on mouseover events nearest=True, # select data point nearest the cursor empty=&#39;none&#39; # empty selection includes no data points ) # define our base line chart of stock prices base = alt.Chart().mark_line().encode( alt.X(&#39;date:T&#39;), alt.Y(&#39;price:Q&#39;, scale=alt.Scale(type=&#39;log&#39;)), alt.Color(&#39;symbol:N&#39;) ) alt.layer( base, # base line chart # add a rule mark to serve as a guide line alt.Chart().mark_rule(color=&#39;#aaa&#39;).encode( x=&#39;date:T&#39; ).transform_filter(label), # add circle marks for selected time points, hide unselected points base.mark_circle().encode( opacity=alt.condition(label, alt.value(1), alt.value(0)) ).add_selection(label), # add white stroked text to provide a legible background for labels base.mark_text(align=&#39;left&#39;, dx=5, dy=-5, stroke=&#39;white&#39;, strokeWidth=2).encode( text=&#39;price:Q&#39; ).transform_filter(label), # add text labels for stock prices base.mark_text(align=&#39;left&#39;, dx=5, dy=-5).encode( text=&#39;price:Q&#39; ).transform_filter(label), data=stocks ).properties( width=500, height=400 ) .

How fastpages Converts Notebooks to Blog Posts . fastpages uses nbdev to power the conversion process of Jupyter Notebooks to blog posts. When you save a notebook into the /_notebooks folder of your repository, GitHub Actions applies nbdev against those notebooks automatically. The same process occurs when you save Word documents or markdown files into the _word or _posts directory, respectively. . We will discuss how GitHub Actions work in a follow up blog post. . Resources &amp; Next Steps . We highly encourage you to start blogging with fastpages! Some resources that may be helpful: . fastpages repo - this is where you can go to create your own fastpages blog! | Fastai forums - nbdev &amp; blogging category. You can ask questions about fastpages here, as well as suggest new features. | nbdev: this project powers the conversion of Jupyter notebooks to blog posts. | .

This guide provides more detail about this syntax, which looks like this: . For example, here is a footnote {% fn 1 %}. And another {% fn 2 %} {{ &#39;This is the footnote.&#39; | fndetail: 1 }} {{ &#39;This is the other footnote. You can even have a [link](www.github.com)!&#39; | fndetail: 2 }} .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .
